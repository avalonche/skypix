# Skypix

Video Streaming React Native App to stream video media with Skypix links. Althought Sia's main is marketed as a cheap, decentralised cloud service, recent improvments to optimise streaming, especially video, has made it feasible for Sia to be a viable CDN. As the costs of mobile data are becoming cheaper, and mobile penetration rates are increasing in many developing countries around the world, there is a huge demand for cheap content streaming services for mobile. It made sense to put the two together and create a video streaming mobile app using Sky links.
